### New version 
The bachelor thesis explores the creation of the visual identity and packaging design of an existing brand - Cider Bohemia, which produces apple products - especially ciders. The current design has several problems. It is inconsistent, difficult to identify and not very attractive. I wanted to make better brand awareness. Good design leads to marketing, to identify the brand, to make brand recognizable. The aim of the work is to create a design that will be attractive to customers and at the same time based on the company's philosophy and does not unnecessarily burden the environment.
