# Chapter IV

Copying is so important in our life. We learn by it, we become better, more experienced and grown-up. When we are small children, we copy our parents, older siblings or friends and learn from them. When we are older, we copy masters in our field or our idols. Even while using some tutorial or recipe, we basically copy what somebody has done before us. 

When I was around 14 years old, I desire to attend Art high school, so I signed up to a drawing atelier. From the very beginning, I learned to copy. Firstly, my teacher showed me how to perceive space. He drew some basic sketches of geometric objects, which he showed me. I tried to copy how he depicts the objects compared to the real models in front of me. After that, I studied new techniques or styles of painting by copying Old masters. From this, I learned new ways how to consider visualization options. 

Last year our teacher of drawing at university gave us the task to create drawings in the style of famous artists of the 20th century. Just like when I was younger, I had to imitate great masters. Again, I learned new ways how to look at space. By observing the picture, you will learn many things. But when you try to do it the same way, as the other artist, you will discover much more. You will understand more the principles of practice the same techniques of creation. 

In the end. When two do the same thing, it's not the same thing.
