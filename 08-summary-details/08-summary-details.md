`Design of new labels for Cider Bohemia`

## Abstract
This bachelor thesis explores the visual identity and product packaging redesign of the brand Cider Bohemia, producer of apple products, mainly ciders. The work aims to create a design that will be attractive to customers and at the same time based on the company's philosophy and does not unnecessarily burden the environment. The redesign process focuses on strengthening brand identity through a more consistent visual design language, visible in product packaging to marketing materials. The redesign intends to demonstrate that good design is good business, leading to good brand awareness and experience.

The theoretical part examines the research in the field of developing a new corporate identity and packaging design. The practical part documents a single visual style applied to packaging design (labels, boxes, etc.). The resulting work is to create a recognizable original visual style, cohesively applied to a new logo, illustrations, labeling and packaging, and online promotional materials.

Keywords: corporate identity, visual identity, packaging design, sustainability

## Choosing a topic for my bachelor thesis
Packaging design is a very interesting topic for me. The designer must solve the complexity of the whole design. Both in terms of design and technology. 
I wanted to create packaging for a Czech company. I found the company Cider Bohemia, which has a beautiful philosophy and great product. But its design had many problems. That's why I agreed with them that I would do my bachelor's thesis for their company. 

## Cider Bohemia
### About company 
Cider Bohemia is a social enterprise. The company mainly employs people with disabilities, people at risk of social exclusion and the long-term unemployable.
The company's philosophy is to live with respect for other people and nature. They use a method of production that not unnecessarily burden the environment. The company use only local resources. 

The company mostly produce craft cider using traditional methods. It owns the first Cider pub in the Czech republic.

### Current visual style
The main problem of the current visual style is its inconsistency. The company uses different logos and different label designs for each flavour. This raises several problems. For customers, this company is not very recognizable in the competition and is difficult to remember. Also there is inconsistency in the company's philosophy and its presentation. Production of the company does not put too much strain on nature, but they use plastic bottles and plastic labels.
Also, I don't consider current labels are very attractive.

## New visual style - Concept
I decided to work with the word Bohemia, not only as the name of the Czech land but also with the theme of bohemianism, as a lifestyle. I try to evoke the atmosphere of Czech romantic bohemianism. It's based on inspiration in Czech romanticism, where Czech bohemians are a frequent subject. 

### Moodboard
The moodboard shows the atmosphere of Czech romanticism. The wildness of the Czech countryside. Aesthetics of the 19th century.

### Logotype
The logotype is created from a serif font. The dot on the letter "i" is transformed into an apple. I also use the apple itself as a symbol in combination with the letter B.

### Illustrations
The illustrations are drawn to act as line drawings. They are created on a tablet in Adobe Fresco, a tool for digital drawing. 
The themes of the illustrations are a bit surreal. They should show bohemian free-thinking and connection with nature.

### Labels
Labels are vertical, respecting the shape of the bottle. They will be printed on light recycled paper.

### Instagram
On social networks I wanted to present ciders on pictures in nature. I want cider to be shown in real enviroment. I am also going to take atmospheric photographs of nature, apples, etc., which would express the atmosphere of the Czech countryside. I am also going to use texts on social networks that are inspired by Czech romanticism literature.

### Other materials
The company has a truck/van which they use as a bar for events. I applied a new design to it. As well as on the boxes in which they send ciders from the e-shop and other materials.
