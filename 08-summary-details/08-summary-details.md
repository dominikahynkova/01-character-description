## Abstract
This bachelor thesis explores the visual identity and product packaging redesign of the brand Cider Bohemia, producer of apple products, mainly ciders. The work aims to create a design that will be attractive to customers and at the same time based on the company's philosophy and does not unnecessarily burden the environment. The redesign process focuses on strengthening brand identity through a more consistent visual design language, visible in product packaging to marketing materials. The redesign intends to demonstrate that good design is good business, leading to good brand awareness and experience.

The theoretical part examines the research in the field of developing a new corporate identity and packaging design. The practical part documents a single visual style applied to packaging design (labels, boxes, etc.). The resulting work is to create a recognizable original visual style, cohesively applied to a new logo, illustrations, labeling and packaging, and online promotional materials.

Keywords: corporate identity, visual identity, packaging design, sustainability
