# Analog photography

## What analog photography means to me
### authenticity
Because when you take analog photos, everything is up to you. The camera does nothing for you, unlike does the digital camera. 

### experiment
Because its very sensitive and everything will affect it. Much more than in digital photography. 
	There are also many defects on old cameras which creates beautiful effects 

### moment of surprise 
You never know how your pictures will look. You don’t see your picture until you develop it. 

## Basics of analog photography
### Choose type of camera 
These are the most used types of analog camera:
- 35mm
- Medium format 

### Choose film 
The right size, black&white x color, positive x negative (you don’t have to care about it if you don’t develop the film by your own, most of the time you will use negative film), number ISO (light sensitivity) 

### Use exposure meter
It’s the tiny mechanism which measure the photography exposure, which means the light coming in you camera, the time of exposure and aperture (It could be build in camera, or you have to use external exposure meter or even today a mobile app) 

## How I started to use analog camera

### My very first picture on analog. 
I love it because of this defect. It happend besauce it was the first picture on a film. The first picture is often partly illuminated and incomplete.

Actually it was horrible, totally broken. It was destroing the films. 

## How the analog helped me get to university
After high school I applied to Film Academy. My specialization was Director of Photography.

## Most of the time I shoot my friends, family and things thats are important
- You need to consider what you want to take a picture of.
