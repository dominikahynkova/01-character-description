## My profile

I am a graphic designer with a sense of simplicity and accuracy, lover of analogue photography, daydreamer, and master in overthinking.
I consider myself as an openminded and talkative person. I enjoy to do complex work and create things in a real, physical environment.
I always seek to go deep and think about the project in a broader context.
